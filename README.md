Created with CodeSandbox
please visit deployed game page -- https://lovely-rugelach-76f9e5.netlify.app/ -- to try it! Game made only for relax and meke personal view on 
how dirty developers can modify algorythm to minimise player reward for odd - even game when player used to maximise reward the Matringale strategy (or maybe you heard about Hock strategy).
bet implemented only on odd or even classes of numbers, not implemented bets on decided numbers and red or black colors, only wanted to see how Hock strategy works without any intrusions into algorithm.
bet could be performed by clicking on preferred buttons odd+1, even+1
to simplify doubling bet used trigger button x2 (on the right side) - when double mode activated the button x2 color changed, 
also if double bet mode activated buttons odd+1, even+1 when bet was made once will be renamed to odd x2, even x2 depending on bet made before.

Once again!
Game made only for relax and try to play using Hock strategy when the game algorith not modified to minimise reward!
